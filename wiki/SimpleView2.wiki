#summary Display debug view for your paths and entities
#labels id-5

Although your paths and entities are rarely used directly for display, it is useful to have some tools showing them for debug.

===Simple view===

Assuming you have instanciated some `DDLSEntityAI` objects and have solved some path datas, you can use the `DDLSSimpleView` class to quickly see them.

example:
{{{
var view:DDLSSimpleView = new DDLSSimpleView();
addChild(view.surface);

view.drawEntity(entityAI);
view.drawPath(path);
}}}

Notice that you can use a single `DDLSSimpleView` instance to display at the same time your triangulation, entities and paths.
