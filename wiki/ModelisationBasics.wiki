#summary Basic tools to build triangulations

The first thing you will want is to create an empty mesh and populate with constraints.

*How to create a new mesh*

Base class for meshes is `DDLSMesh`. Keep in mind this class because it manages almost all constraints insertion and deletion.

Although it is possible to instanciate directly a `DDLSMesh` object, it is not the more  convenient way to proceed. Think that Daedalus Lib implements triangulations through complex half-edge data structure, making them very hard to create from scratch for beginners.

Instead use the static:

`DDLSRectMeshFactory.buildRectangle(width:Number, height:Number):DDLSMesh`

example:

{{{
var mesh:DDLSMesh = DDLSRectMeshFactory.buildRectangle(600, 400);
}}}

The result is an instance of `DDLSMesh` as a 2 polygons rectangle of size 600x400.
